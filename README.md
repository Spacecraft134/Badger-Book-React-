# CS571-S25 HW4: Badger Book (React!)

Badger Book (React Edition) is a student directory app built using **React** and **React-Bootstrap**.  
It was developed as part of **CS571: Building User Interfaces** at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.  
The app fetches and displays student data, supports live search, reset, and pagination features,  
and adapts to different screen sizes using a responsive grid layout.

**Disclaimer:** This project was originally created for CS571 coursework and uses course-specific APIs.  
These APIs require authentication with a CS571 Badger ID and will **not function outside the course environment**.  
This repository is for **demonstration and learning purposes only**.
